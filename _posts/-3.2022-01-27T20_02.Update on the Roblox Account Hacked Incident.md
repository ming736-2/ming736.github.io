Add images from migration

It seems that the hackers had attempted to change my password and log me out, but failed miserably. They didn't change the email! Because of this, I was able to reset my password, link my phone, enable 2SV and 2FA. And Roblox Support is on my side! Isn't that great? I'll keep you updated. (fun fact i lost 4,401 robux)
